🌿 Advanced Pest Detection and Management System

Using Deep Learning (MobileNetV2), OpenCV & Gradio

1️⃣ Project Overview

Agriculture faces major losses due to pest infestations. Traditional pest identification requires expert knowledge and is time-consuming.
This project proposes an AI-based pest detection system that:

Automatically detects pests from crop images

Identifies the type of pest

Provides confidence score

Suggests treatment, prevention, and medicines

Runs as a web-based application

The system combines:

Deep Learning (MobileNetV2) for accurate classification

OpenCV for fast preliminary pest detection

Gradio for an easy-to-use user interface

2️⃣ Objectives of the Project

To detect whether a pest is present in an image

To classify the detected pest accurately

To reduce false predictions on healthy crops

To provide actionable agricultural guidance

To create a lightweight and fast application suitable for real-world use
